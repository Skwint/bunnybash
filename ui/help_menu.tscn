Goop Bunnies are eating all our dumb Brocolli!
Get Them!

each game takes from 10pm to 2am, so they last 4 minutes (don't think about it)
You begin with 1000 points and lose one point each time a bunny eats some broccoli
when a bunny eats it will expand and then, probably, divide into 4 smaller bunnies
you can stop bunnies by pushing them off the roof 
(unless you are sally, who is more ... direct ...)

Movement is with W A S D
Each character has two skills bound to left click and right click
each skill has a cooldown shown in the blue bars above your characters head
there is no mana, so feel free to go nuts

this game is about as balanced as an inverted cone but I hope it is at least funny"
